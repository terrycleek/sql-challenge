Module 9 Homework

## Data Modeling 
* Used Quickdatabasediagrams to model and sketch a Entity Relationship digram for the different data sets.
*https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com
*See Image ERD.png in sql-challenge directory

--
## Created Table Schema 
* Used pgAdmin to create a table schema of the 6 different data sets. I produced the schema out of order. which means I had to run some sections one by one to be able to produce the different tables. I realized this after the fact. It also then produced the issue of having to upload the different csv files in a somehwat unique order as well. But it all eventually worked. Just took a little extra time.
* See Schemata.sql file in sql-challenge directory

## Data Analysis

* Aswered the 8 different questions using SQL and pgAdmin
* See Data_analysis_queries.sql file in the sql-challenge-directory

I did not use any syntax shortcuts where I probably should have to simplify things. Also had to reference the solutions to be able to figure out two of the questions.
